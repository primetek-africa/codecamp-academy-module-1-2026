# JavaScript Objects: A Professional Introduction

## 1. Introduction

In JavaScript, **objects** are one of the most important and fundamental data 
structures. They allow developers to group related data and functionality into 
a single entity.

Before diving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it is essential to 
understand how objects work using **key-value notation**.

Objects are used everywhere in JavaScript: from representing users and products 
to handling API responses and configuring applications.

## 2. What is an Object?

An object is a collection of **key-value pairs**.

* A **key** (also called a property name) is a string
* A **value** can be any data type (number, string, boolean, array, function, or even another object)

### Example

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "Charles",
  age: 27,
  isActive: true
};
```

In this example:

* `name`, `age`, and `isActive` are **keys**
* Their associated values are "Charles", `27`, and `true`

---

## 3. Key-Value Notation

The structure of an object follows this pattern:

```javascript
const objectName = {
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2,
    key3: value3
};
```

### Important Rules

* Keys are usually written in **camelCase**
* Keys are implicitly strings (you can omit quotes if valid identifiers)
* Each key-value pair is separated by a comma

### Example

```javascript
const product = {
    id: 101,
    name: "Laptop",
    price: 1500,
    inStock: true
};
```

---

## 4. Accessing Object Properties

### Dot Notation

```javascript
console.log(product.name); // Laptop
```

### Bracket Notation

```javascript
console.log(product["price"]); // 1500
```

### When to Use Bracket Notation

* When the key contains spaces
* When the key is dynamic (stored in a variable)

```javascript
const key = "name";
console.log(product[key]);
```

---

## 5. Modifying Objects

### Updating Values

```javascript
product.price = 1400;
```

### Adding New Properties

```javascript
product.category = "Electronics";
```

### Deleting Properties

```javascript
delete product.inStock;
```

---

## 6. Objects with Different Data Types

Objects can store multiple types of data, including arrays and functions.

### Example

```javascript
const student = {
    name: "Ana",
    grades: [90, 85, 88],
    greet: function () {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
    }
};
```

---

## 7. Nested Objects

Objects can contain other objects.

### Example

```javascript
const company = {
    name: "TechCorp",
    address: {
        city: "Paris",
        country: "France"
    }
};

console.log(company.address.city); // Paris
```

---

## 8. Iterating Over Objects

### Using `for...in`

```javascript
for (let key in product) {
    console.log(key, product[key]);
}
```

### Using `Object.keys()`

```javascript
Object.keys(product).forEach(key => {
    console.log(key, product[key]);
});
```

---

## 9. Objects vs Arrays

| Feature   | Object          | Array               |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Structure | Key-value pairs | Indexed elements    |
| Access    | By key          | By index            |
| Use case  | Structured data | Ordered collections |

---

## 10. Common Use Cases of Objects

* Representing real-world entities (users, products, orders)
* Handling API responses (JSON format)
* Configuration objects
* Grouping related data and behavior

---

## 11. Common Mistakes

### Missing Commas

```javascript
const user = {
    name: "John"
    age: 30 // Error
};
```

### Incorrect Property Access

```javascript
console.log(user.age); // Works
console.log(user[age]); // Error if age is not defined
```

---

## 12. Summary

JavaScript objects are a foundational concept that every developer must master 
before learning Object-Oriented Programming.

Key takeaways:

* Objects store data using key-value pairs
* Values can be any data type
* Properties can be accessed using dot or bracket notation
* Objects are flexible and widely used in real-world applications

Understanding objects will prepare you to work with more advanced concepts such
as classes, prototypes, and full OOP design patterns.
