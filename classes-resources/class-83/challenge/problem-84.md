# Code Challenge: Improve the Shopping Cart System

## Challenge Overview

Great job building your first **Shopping Cart System** 
using Object-Oriented Programming.

Now it is time to improve your solution like real software engineers.

Your challenge is to extend the current system by implementing new features and 
improving the business logic.

You must **analyze the problem**, **design the solution**, and **implement it 
using classes and methods in JavaScript**.

Do **not** rewrite the entire system from scratch. Instead, improve the 
previous solution.

# Challenge Requirements

Your shopping cart system must now support the following new features.

## 1. Discount System

Add support for discounts.

The customer should be able to receive a percentage discount on the 
total purchase.

### Example

```text
Total purchase: $500
Discount: 10%
Final total: $450
```

### Hint

Ask yourself:

* Should discount be a property or calculated dynamically?
* Do you need a new method?
* How can you calculate a percentage?

Think about:

```text
original total - discount amount
```

---

## 2. Tax Calculation

The store now applies taxes to purchases.

You must calculate taxes based on the subtotal.

### Example

```text
Subtotal: $100
Tax: 19%
Final price: $119
```

### Hint

Ask yourself:

* Should taxes be fixed or configurable?
* Should tax calculation happen inside another method?
* What happens if discounts are applied before taxes?

Think carefully about the order of calculations.

---

## 3. Empty Cart Feature

Add a feature that allows customers to empty their cart.

### Hint

Ask yourself:

* Which property needs to change?
* What should happen to the quantity?
* What message should be returned?

---

## 4. Product Stock Validation

The store has limited inventory.

The cart should not allow customers to add more products than available.

### Example

```text
Available stock: 5
Customer tries to add: 10
```

Expected behavior:

```text
Not enough stock available.
```

### Hint

Ask yourself:

* Do you need a new property?
* Where should validation happen?
* Which method is responsible for adding products?

---

## 5. Purchase Summary

Create a method that displays a detailed purchase summary.

The summary should include:

* Customer name
* Product name
* Quantity
* Product price
* Subtotal
* Discount applied
* Tax applied
* Final total

### Hint

Think like a software engineer:

Instead of writing all calculations repeatedly:

* Can one method call another method?
* Can calculations be reused?

Try to avoid duplicated logic.

---

# Rules

You must:

* Use a **class**.
* Use a **constructor**.
* Add new **properties if necessary**.
* Create new **methods when needed**.
* Reuse existing methods when possible.
* Use **conditional logic**.
* Use `console.log()` to test your program.

You must **not**:

* Hardcode values directly in methods.
* Duplicate calculations unnecessarily.
* Rewrite the whole project.

---

# Goal

This challenge is designed to help you practice:

* Problem solving
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Code organization
* Business logic implementation
* Method reuse
* Software design thinking

Think before coding.

A good software engineer first understands the problem, then designs the solution.
