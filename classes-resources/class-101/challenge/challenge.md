# React Challenge: Speaker Card

## Overview

You've already seen how the **Tech Conference 2026** dashboard works 
attendees can toggle their registration status and sessions can be registered 
or unregistered. Now it's your turn to extend the application by building one 
new component from scratch: a **SpeakerCard**.

---

## Your Mission

Create `src/components/SpeakerCard.jsx` and integrate it into the existing app.

### The Data

Add this array directly in `App.jsx` as a regular variable 
(no `useState` needed here):

```js
const speakers = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Ada Lovelace",
    topic: "The Future of Functional Programming",
    bio: "Pioneer of computer science and mathematical genius.",
    available: true
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Alan Turing",
    topic: "Machine Intelligence and the Limits of Computation",
    bio: "Father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.",
    available: true
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Grace Hopper",
    topic: "Compilers: From Human Readable to Machine Code",
    bio: "Inventor of the first compiler and pioneer of programming languages.",
    available: false
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "Linus Torvalds",
    topic: "Open Source and the Linux Kernel",
    bio: "Creator of the Linux kernel and the Git version control system.",
    available: true
  }
];
```

## Requirements

### `SpeakerCard.jsx`

This component receives a single `speaker` object as a prop and must render:

- The speaker's **name** in a heading `<h3>`
- Their **talk topic** with a 🎤 emoji prefix
- Their **bio** in a `<p>` tag
- An **availability status label**:
  - Show `"✅ Available for Q&A"` styled in green when `available` is `true`
  - Show `"❌ Unavailable"` styled in red when `available` is `false`
- A **toggle button**:
  - When available → button says `"Mark Unavailable"` with a red background
  - When unavailable → button says `"Mark Available"` with a blue background

> The `available` prop is only the **initial value**. Availability state 
must be managed **inside `SpeakerCard`** using `useState` initialized 
from the prop.

### `App.jsx`

- Declare the `speakers` array above the component function
- Render all 4 speakers **below `<SessionList />`** using `.map()`
- Wrap them in a `<section>` with a heading that says `"Speakers"`
- Pass each speaker object as a prop named `speaker`
- Don't forget the `key` prop

---

## Styling

Create `src/styles/SpeakerCard.css` and import it inside `SpeakerCard.jsx`. 
Your styles must follow the existing design system:

- Card background: `white`
- Border radius: `18px`
- Box shadow: `0 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`
- Hover effect: `translateY(-4px)`
- Available status color: `#059669`
- Unavailable status color: `#dc2626`
- Button width: `100%`, padding: `12px`, border radius: `10px`

You must define **two separate CSS classes** for the button one for each state,
and apply them conditionally, exactly like `AttendeeCard` does.

---

## Rules

- Do **not** modify any existing component
- No inline styles, all styling goes in `SpeakerCard.css`
- No external libraries, pure React and CSS only
- The `key` prop must use the speaker's `id`, not the array index
